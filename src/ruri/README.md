# Download:    
You can get ruri binary (statically linked) for arm64, armv7, armhf, riscv64, i386, loong64, s390x, ppc64le and x86_64 devices in [Release](https://github.com/Moe-hacker/ruri/releases/).      
Or you can run the following command to download ruri automatically:      
```sh
wget -O - https://github.com/Moe-hacker/ruri/raw/refs/heads/main/get-ruri.sh | bash -s -- -s
```
This will automatically download ruri binary to `./ruri`.

# About:         
&emsp;ruri is pronounced as  `luli`, or you can call it `瑠璃` in Chinese or Japanese as well.       
&emsp;ruri is acronym to Lightweight, User-friendly Linux-container Implementation. It's designed to provide better security for Linux containers on devices that do not support docker.       
- Simple:      
The basic usage is very very simple, you can use it just like the command `chroot`.
- Secure:      
Ruri focus on security, with many built-in protections.
- Run Everywhere:      
ruri officially supports multipe platforms: arm64, armv7, armhf, riscv64, i386, loong64, s390x, ppc64le and x86_64.         
The ruri binary is very small, only about 1M, and you can also use `upx` to make it less than 500k, so it can be run anywhere even if the storage is tight.                
# Container Security:  
See [Enhance Container Security](doc/Security.md).      
# Build:      
```
git clone https://github.com/Moe-hacker/ruri
cd ruri
make static_config
make
sudo cp ruri /usr/bin/ruri
```
# NOTE:
The test script has a part that must be run with `sudo`, `DO NOT` run `make test` on your devices!!!!      
# Build options:
```
make config        # configure
make static_config # static build

#### Only For Developers ####

make dev_config    # dev build
make dbg_config    # dev build with debug log
```
After running one of these command, you can now `make`.      
Note that `-j` option will not have any effect since ruri use NOTPARALLEL flag.      
## Build Debian package: 
Debian do not like static binary, so in debian package, ruri is dynamically linked.      
You can run:       
```sh
apt update
apt build-dep . -y
dpkg-buildpackage -b -us -uc -d
```
This will bulid the debian package.      
# Integration:
ruri is ready to integrate into other projects, with the MIT License, it is compatiblte to be redistribute with almost all license, or commercial/closed source.      
See [Integration](doc/Integration.md) for a guide to integrate ruri into your projects.    
# Usage:    
See [USAGE](doc/USAGE.md)      
# FAQ:   
[FAQ](doc/FAQ.md)      
# Quick start(with rootfstool):
## Download and unpack a rootfs:
```
git clone https://github.com/Moe-hacker/rootfstool
cd rootfstool
./rootfstool download -d alpine -v edge
mkdir /tmp/alpine
sudo tar -xvf rootfs.tar.xz -C /tmp/alpine
```
## Then:
```
sudo ruri /tmp/alpine
```
For unshare container:      
```
sudo ruri -u /tmp/alpine
```
Very simple as you can see.    
For command line examples, please see `ruri -H`.      
# Example Usage:      
```
# Run chroot container:
  sudo ruri /tmp/alpine
# Very simple as you can see.
# About the capabilities:
# Run privileged chroot container:
  sudo ruri -p /tmp/alpine
# If you want to run privileged chroot container,
# but you don't want to give the container cap_sys_chroot privileges:
  sudo ruri -p -d cap_sys_chroot /tmp/alpine
# If you want to run chroot container with common privileges,
# but you want cap_sys_admin to be kept:
  sudo ruri -k cap_sys_admin /tmp/alpine
# About unshare:
# Unshare container's capability options are same with chroot.
# Run unshare container:
  sudo ruri -u /tmp/alpine
# Umount the container:
  sudo ruri -U /tmp/alpine
```
